# Cinta-Sayang-Tailoring-System-GROUP-PROJECT

Cinta‑Sayang‑Tailoring‑System is a tailoring / garment‑order management application (written in Java). The repository contains classes like BajuKurung, BajuMelayu, TailorOrder, plus a main class, which suggests it supports orders for different clothing types. From the file names (e.g. “TailorOrder”) the system likely manages tailoring orders — maybe storing order information such as garment type, customer order details, and supporting generation or tracking of tailor-made clothes.

What It Does / Key Functionalities:
The presence of separate classes for different clothing types (BajuKurung, BajuMelayu) suggests the system handles multiple kinds of garments (i.e. it’s not just generic clothes but recognizes different clothing styles).
The TailorOrder class likely encapsulates information about specific tailoring orders — e.g. which garment, order metadata (customer, measurements, status), maybe price or schedule.
The system is likely a console or desktop Java application (since it’s pure Java), which can create, store, and manage tailoring orders.
As a tailoring‑management system, it likely replaces manual paper‑based ordering with digitally managed orders, making record‑keeping more reliable (less risk of lost data), easier search of orders, and better organization of garments and customer orders. This is a typical goal for tailoring management software.

Implementation Details:
The project is implemented 100% in Java (as shown on the repo page). 
GitHub
It includes Java class files (.java) such as BajuKurung, BajuMelayu, TailorOrder, and a Main.java, which suggests an entry point for the application.
